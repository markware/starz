In the tradition continued by [Konquest](http://linux.about.com/cs/linux101/g/konquest.htm), Starz hopes to create a base that meets Konquest and can be evolutionarily improved.

It is a game with a grid of cells forming a space map with quantities of planets. Each planet has a number of ships, production rates and attack/defense stats.

Games are predicted to last anywhere from 20 to 40 turns, until somebody wins the day or the final turn occurs.
